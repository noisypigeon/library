## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-14

### Follow pigeon.dev's DEV- prefix rename

[DEV-0161](https://github.com/noisypigeon/pigeon.dev/pull/17) flattened `pigeon.dev`'s ADR corpus to `adr/` and re-prefixed it `PD-` → `DEV-`. This repo holds **133** of those citations, so they follow.

### Why rewrite rather than grandfather

PD-0160 grandfathered 1,100+ bare `ADR-NNNN` on volume: rewriting them would churn published changelog entries and another repo's `.hcl`/`.tf`. `PD-` carries none of that weight and was one day old, so DEV-0161 rewrote it instead — leaving **two** live spellings for that corpus rather than three. This PR is this repo's share of that.

Breakdown of the 133:

| Where | Count |
| --- | --- |
| `LIB-0001` + `LIB-0002` | 82 |
| five published module changelogs | 20 |
| `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `terraform/README.md`, the skill | 14 |
| workflows and scripts | 17 |

### The published changelogs are included, deliberately

NPC-0000's precedent is that published changelog copy is **not** retrofitted to a later layout — the reason those files still carry `docs/adr/` paths that stopped existing two moves ago. It doesn't bite here, and I checked rather than assumed:

- Those versions have **no GitHub Release in this repo** to diverge from (`gh release view` → `release not found`). The historical Releases live in `noisypigeon` under the old `templates/terraform/…` tag names.
- The site's release posts are **generated** from these files, so rewriting keeps file and published post consistent rather than splitting them.

DEV-0161's permanent boundary covers bare `ADR-NNNN`, not `PD-`, so this is in scope rather than against it.

One quotation needed care: `LIB-0002` quotes LIB-0001's own phrase *"re-opens every coupling PD-0156 closed"*. Since LIB-0001 is rewritten in the same commit, the quote stays an accurate quotation of its source.

### Verified

- `grep -r 'PD-'` over the repo returns **0**.
- Bare `ADR-NNNN` is **334 before and after** — the grandfathering is not collateral damage.
- `shellcheck` clean on both fetched scripts and `resolve-theme.sh`; `actionlint` clean apart from the pre-existing `terragrunt-run.yml` SC2242 that predates this repo.
- The generator still produces 49 / 13 / 4 / 87 after its comment rewrite — same counts as before.

### On merge

Touches `.github/workflows/` and `.github/scripts/`, so `template-release.yml` cuts **`workflows/v1.0.3`** with this body as its changelog entry and Release notes. No module or theme release: no `.tf` and no theme asset changes.

The five callers stay pinned at `v1.0.2`. A pin exists so it needn't track latest, and the delta here is comment text — but `pigeon.dev` will pin **v1.0.3** when it starts fetching, so it gets the DEV-corrected scripts from the outset.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-10-13

### Version the generator with the workflows track

Corrects a placement mistake from #4, before Phase C pins anything to a version.

### The gap

I put `generate-module-redirects.sh` at the repo root. The `workflows/` release predicate covers `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.github/scripts/` — so the generator sat outside it. A spoke pinning `@workflows/vX.Y.Z` would have got a pinned *workflow* and a generator tracked from `main`: invariant 2 half-satisfied, in exactly the branch-tracking direction it exists to forbid. A hub commit touching the generator would have reached every site's next build with no version change to show for it.

Moving it beside `root-changelog.sh` — the other script spokes fetch — means **one pin covers everything a spoke takes from the hub**.

### The path arithmetic, re-verified rather than assumed

`LIB_ROOT` is derived from `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` precisely so the script finds the clone it was fetched into rather than the consuming site's repo. Moving the file down two directories invalidates that derivation — the same class of breakage the flatten caused in `resolve-theme.sh`, where `../..` silently became one level too high.

So it climbs two levels now, and the proof is empirical: the generator's output from `.github/scripts/` is **byte-identical** to its output from the root — same 49 / 13 / 4 / 87 counts, and `diff -r` across all three content directories is clean.

The comment now also says *why* the arithmetic is what it is, so the next move doesn't get it wrong by inheritance.

### On merge

This touches `.github/scripts/`, so it fires the `workflows/` track and cuts **`workflows/v1.0.2`** — and that is the ref Phase C pins into five caller files across two repos. I'll confirm the cut version before writing it anywhere, since a typo'd ref is how `noisypigeon`'s merge gate gets stuck.

`root-changelog.yml` stands down; `template-release.yml` writes the `[workflows]` line.

[#5](https://github.com/noisypigeon/pigeon-lib/pull/5)

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-13

### Stand down root-changelog for the workflows release track

Fixes a bug I introduced in #2.

### What broke

#2 added `.github/` as a third releasable unit to `template-release.yml`, but left `root-changelog.yml`'s stand-down predicate checking only the module and theme arms. So on a `.github/`-only PR both workflows concluded they owned the root changelog line:

- `root-changelog.yml` saw "not a release" → wrote `- [ci] …`
- `template-release.yml` saw "release" → wrote `- [workflows] …`

Both insert into the same `## YYYY-MM-DD` section, so the second one to rebase hit `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in CHANGELOG.md` and `template-release`'s commit step failed.

DEV-0160 named this risk in the same breath as it created it — the predicates are duplicated across two workflows on purpose, and it wrote that "if one drifts, a PR gets either two root lines or none". This is that drift, one commit after the track was added. The fix is the third arm, and the comment now says what happened so the next person adding a track sees the cost of forgetting.

### Nothing was lost

The collision failed *before* the tag step, so #2 cut no tag and no Release — `git tag -l` was still 53 afterward. `workflows/v1.0.0` has since been seeded by hand at `main`, with the GitHub Release carrying the entry #2 already wrote for it, exactly as #2's changelog entry said would happen.

#2's own root line reads `[ci]` rather than `[workflows]`, which is accurate in retrospect: it released nothing.

### A correction to something #2's body asserted

I said `template-release.yml` wouldn't fire on #2's merge because "a `pull_request: closed` workflow runs from the base branch" — DEV-0154 §9's reasoning, which I took at face value. **It fired**, and the run's step list proves it used the *head* version: it executed "Determine reusable-CI change", a step that only existed on the branch.

So for `pull_request`, GitHub evaluates both the `paths:` filter and the job bodies from the PR's merge commit, not the base. DEV-0154's conclusion — split "retire the automation" from "delete the content" into separate PRs — is still the prudent order, but its stated *reason* doesn't hold, and anything relying on that reason should be re-checked rather than inherited. I'll carry the correction into LIB-0002.

### On merge

This PR touches `.github/`, so with the fix applied from head: `root-changelog.yml` stands down, and `template-release.yml` cuts `workflows/v1.0.1` with this body as its changelog entry and Release notes — the first release this track cuts on its own, and the real test of it.

[#3](https://github.com/noisypigeon/pigeon-lib/pull/3)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-13

### Seed the reusable CI's version track

`workflows/v1.0.0` is a seed tag, written by hand rather than by
`template-release.yml`, because the automation that cuts this track is itself
introduced by the PR that this entry documents — and a `pull_request: closed`
workflow runs from the **base** branch, so the version it adds cannot cut its
own first release. The same bootstrapping pattern DEV-0110 used for its five
module seed tags.

It marks the reusable CI as it stood when `pigeon-lib` was stood up by LIB-0002:
the five workflows the spokes call (`terragrunt-detect`, `terragrunt-run`,
`blog-changelog`, `interaction-limits-renew`, `zola-site-pages`), plus
`.github/scripts/root-changelog.sh`, which they fetch.

**No behaviour change from the last `@main` state the spokes consumed**, beyond
what LIB-0002's flatten already required: `zola-site-pages.yml` takes
`fetch_script`/`theme_script` instead of a hardcoded `.templates-src` path, and
`zola-site-deploy.yml` is gone — it had no caller in any repo and its own
`:60` hardcoded a path into a caller's checkout that DEV-0159 had moved away.

From here the track behaves like the other two: one `release:*` label per PR,
the PR body becomes this file's entry and the GitHub Release notes verbatim.

PR: see LIB-0002.
